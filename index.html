    <h1>Program Describe</h1>
    <p>We try to analyze the citation relationship of sphere and codes. In the year form, we will provide all the cited articles and their URLs. We organize them by time. 
        We will also provide a visual dynamic graph, which you can zoom in and out and rotate by clicking and dragging. It is worth mentioning that the gray line represents the citation center article, 
        and the red line represents the mutual citation between the citing articles. Finally, we use this as a knowledge base to create a chatbot equipped with deepseek, which can help you use and understand 
        it to a higher level.</p>
