    <h1>Program Describe</h1>
    <div class="description">
        <p>Our program aims to conduct in - depth research on the citation relationship between spheres and codes. This analysis is crucial as it helps us understand the connections and dependencies within the relevant academic and technical fields.</p>
        <h2>1. Year - based Information</h2>
        <p>In the year - based form, we offer a comprehensive collection of all cited articles. Each entry includes the title of the article and its corresponding URL, allowing users to easily access the original sources. We organize these articles by time, starting from the earliest to the most recent. This chronological arrangement enables users to track the development of research over time, understand the evolution of ideas, and identify emerging trends in the study of spheres and codes.</p>
        <h2>2. Visual Dynamic Graph</h2>
        <p>To provide a more intuitive understanding of the citation relationships, we present a visual dynamic graph. This graph is highly interactive. Users can zoom in and out to focus on specific areas of interest or get an overall view of the entire citation network. By clicking and dragging, they can freely rotate the graph, exploring different perspectives. In this graph, the gray line plays a significant role. It represents the citation center article, which is often a highly influential piece of work that many other articles refer to. The red lines, on the other hand, indicate the mutual citations between citing articles. These mutual citations reveal the collaborative and interconnected nature of research in the field.</p>
        <h2>3. Chatbot with DeepSeek</h2>
        <p>Finally, we leverage the knowledge base created from the analysis of citation relationships to develop a chatbot equipped with DeepSeek technology. This chatbot serves as a powerful tool for users. It can answer various questions related to the cited articles, the citation relationships, and the overall research in the sphere - code field. Whether you are a novice trying to get an introduction or an expert looking for in - depth insights, the chatbot can help you use and understand the information to a higher level.We provide you with a guide here.<a href="Chatbot Usage Guide.html">guide</a></p>
